1. Introduction to secure transmission platform
  Infrastructure Platform (referred to as the Data Transmission Platform) is an infrastructure project that provides unified and standard information security services for information systems of groups and enterprises. Solve transmission security, message security, identity authentication and authentication between enterprises and point to point; It can solve the security data transmission between new cloud service nodes; It can also solve the key problems of traditional security product deployment, such as scattered, inefficient, and vulnerable systems. It is a data security transmission solution under the "logic concentration" and "business concentration" of information system.
    ————————In short: provide encryption algorithm and key for third party information system; Ensure secure communication between information systems point to point.
Complex to say: to solve the security key distribution, high concurrency cryptographic operation equipment group calls, unified encryption and decryption interface. Manage access nodes.
